## Introduction

<p style='text-align: justify'>
Yelp is one of the popular platforms that publishes reviews about businesses worldwide. Business owners could improve the performance of their business services by using the rich information on Yelp.com and could achieve a higher number of positive reviews.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>
This project focuses on predicting ratings of restaurants in New York City based on the features of each restaurant (price range, number of reviews, opening hours, etc.) that are available on Yelp.com. </p>
 
## Project Phases
<p style='text-align: justify'>
The project has been carried out by first acquiring the restaurants data using web scraping techniques. Then, working on data cleaning and preprocessing. After that, creating a baseline model using the Linear Regression algorithm and performing features engineering to enhance the results of the learning model.
</p>

### Data Acquisition
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The data of the restaurants was acquired from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=fine+dining&find_loc=New+York%2C+NY">Yelp.com</a> using web scraping techniques with Selenium tool in Python and Firefox WebDriver. The data of about a thousand restaurants was collected by taking a list from each price range category (Inexpensive $, Moderate $$, Pricey $$$, Ultra High-End $$$$).
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify'>
From each restaurant, thirteen features were collected that include: Restaurant Name, Rating, Number of Reviews, Price Range, Food Type, Number of Photos, and the Opening Hours for each day of the week (from Monday to Sunday). The figure below shows a sample page of some NYC restaurant with specifying the scraped features.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The following steps of data cleansing and preprocessing were performed on the dataset to ensure that the data is correct, consistent and useable.
</p>

- __Assigning the right datatype for each column:__ Rating, Number of Reviews, Number of Photos were assigned a numercal datatype to help in the calculation process.

- __Calculating the opening hours:__ For each working day, the opening hours were calculated by finding the difference between the opening and closing hours.

- __Handling missing values:__ Some restaurants data were dropped since their pages do not offer daily working hours.

Below is a snapshot of the final dataframe.

### Baseline Model
An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model was created using only the numerical features in the dataset to estimate the initial values of the parameters of the Linear Regression Model. Below is a summary of the statistical results of the model.

The figures below show the Resedual Plot and the Q-Q Plot for the created model.

### Feature Engineering 
To improve the performance of the model, feature engineering was performed for two features: the Rating and the Price Range.
- __Power Transformation:__ power transformation was performed on variable Rating (the target) to satisfy a normal distribution for the target. The figures below show the distribution of te target before and after the transformation.

- __Price Range Encoding:__ 
The price range variable was encoded using (get dummies).

### Linear Regression Model
Different alphas were iterated to find the best alpha value for Ridge and Lasso. The score of the best alpha for Ridge is shown below

## Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, Linear Regression Model may not be the most suitable selection for this problem, since the ratings of the restaurants are not continuous (with 0.5 difference, i.e. 1, 1.5, 2 ..., etc).
Also, the users' reviews in the website could be biased toward personal reasons or for specific food types. Thus, it would be challenging to accurately predict some rating of a restaurant.

For future work, there are some points to consider:
- Scrape the geographical location of the restaurant
- Find the underlying (continuous value) of the restaurant ratings by calculating the average of all users' reviews 
- Use other resources to fill the missing values (such as the opening hours of a restaurant)
- Make use of users' text reviews (perform Natural Language Processing NLP).
