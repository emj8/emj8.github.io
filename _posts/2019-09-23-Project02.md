## Introduction
<p style='text-align: justify'>
Yelp is one of the popular platforms that publishes reviews about businesses worldwide. Business owners could improve the performance of their business services by using the rich information on Yelp.com and could achieve a higher number of positive reviews.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>
This project focuses on predicting ratings of restaurants in New York City based on the features of each restaurant (price range, number of reviews, opening hours, etc.) that are available on Yelp.com. </p>
 
## Project Phases
<p style='text-align: justify'>
The project has been carried out by first acquiring the restaurants data using web scraping techniques. Then, working on cleaning and preprocessing the data. After that, creating a baseline model using the Linear Regression algorithm and performing features engineering to enhance the results of the learning model.
</p>

### Data Acquisition
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The data of the restaurants was acquired from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=fine+dining&find_loc=New+York%2C+NY">Yelp.com</a> using web scraping techniques with Selenium tool in Python and FireFox WebDriver. The data of about a thousand restaurants was collected by taking a list from each price range category (Inexpensive $, Moderate $$, Pricey $$$, Ultra High-End $$$$).
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify'>
From each restaurant, thirteen features were collected that include: Restaurant Name, Rating, Number of Reviews, Price Range, Food Type, Number of Photos, and the Opening Hours for each day of the week (from Monday to Sunday). The figure below shows a sample page of some NYC restaurant with specifying the scraped features.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The following steps of data cleansing and preprocessing were performed on the dataset to help in the analysis process and to ensure that the data is correct, consistent and useable.

- __Eliminating the unnecessary columns:__ After the dataframe was loaded, some columns were dropped that would not contribute to our analysis. They include 'Restaurant Name', 'Restaurant ', 'DIVISION', 'DESC'.

- __Calculating the Filtering the data to include only the dates in the month of may__

- __Detecting and handling outliers:__ We have found that there are some records that looked really abnormal and the one and only
