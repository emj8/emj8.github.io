## Problem Statement
As a passionate group at Metis, our task for the first project is to help WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) achieve their goal. WTWY aims to arrange an annual gala at the beginning of the summer. However, they would like some help to find the most efficient plan to optimize their street teams so that they can get email signups from people who are most willing to attend the gala and contribute to WTWY.

By using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on the data, we should be able to list the most suitable stations and days to deploy the street teams to target the most interested people.

## Approach
The steps that were followed in this project are: acquiring the data, preprocessing the data, visualizing and exploring the data, and finally analyzing the results and outlining the recommendations. 

We would suggest a list of stations for the street teams in terms of two things: the highest total entries for each station and the proximity of the station to tech companies and to ensure that the street teams find a great number of commuters that would mostly be interested about WTWY.


## Data Acquisition 
In this project, [MTA Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) is used that includes data about the entries and exits for all New York subway stations. 

Since the gala is planned to take place at the beginning of the summer, we have selected the data for the month of May only. Thus, all the dates were filtered to be within the month of May.


## Preprocessing the Data
The following steps of data cleansing and preprocessing were performed on the dataset to help in the analysis process and to ensure that the data is correct, consistent and useable.

- __Eliminating the unnecessary columns:__ After the dataframe was loaded, we have dropped the columns that would not contribute to our analysis. They include 'C/A', 'LINENAME', 'DIVISION', 'DESC'.

- __Creating a unique identifier for each turnstile:__ The __UNIT__ and __SCP__ together is a unique identifier of a turnstile. So, we have created the column __UNIT/SCP__ that combined both of the columns to serve as a unique identifier for each turnstile

- __Filtering the data to include only the dates in the month of may__

- __Sorting the data by STATION, UNIT/SCP, DATE_TIME__: The data were sorted first by __STATION__, __UNIT/SCP__, then by __DATE_TIME__ and that is to make sure when we calculate the total entries for the stations that each turnstile in every station is sorted ascendingly by date since the dataset is randomly sorted.

- __Calculate entries/exits columns:__ For each __UNIT/SCP__ we calculated the entries and exits for each record and that is by subtracting entries/exits of each record from the entries/exits of the previous record and assigned them to the new columns __ENTRIES_DIFF__ and __EXITS_DIFF__ and finally add both the columns and assign it to __TOTAL_TRAFFIC__ column, as shown in the figure below.

- __Detecting and handling outliers:__ We have found that there are some records that looked really abnormal and the one and only
