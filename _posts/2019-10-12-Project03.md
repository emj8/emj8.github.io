## Introduction

<p style='text-align: justify'>
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify'>
This project focuses on classifying categories of fashion items of Zalando's article images using classification models (custom models, sklearn plug-n-play classifiers).
</p>
 
## Project Phases
<p style='text-align: justify'>
The project has been carried out by first acquiring the data. Then, visualizing the data and working on data preprocessing. After that, creating a baseline model and then using different types of classification models and performing features engineering to enhance the results of the learning model.
</p>

### Data Acquisition
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The data of the restaurants were acquired from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=fine+dining&find_loc=New+York%2C+NY">Yelp.com</a> using web scraping techniques with Selenium tool in Python and Firefox WebDriver. The data of about a thousand restaurants were collected by taking a list from each price range category (Inexpensive $, Moderate $$, Pricey $$$, Ultra High-End $$$$).
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify'>
From each restaurant, thirteen features were collected that include: Restaurant Name, Rating, Number of Reviews, Price Range, Food Type, Number of Photos, and the Opening Hours for each day of the week (from Monday to Sunday). The figure below shows a sample page of some NYC restaurant with specifying the scraped features.
