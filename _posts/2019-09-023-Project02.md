## Introduction
Yelp is one of the popular platforms that publishes reviews about businesses worldwide. Using the rich information on Yelp.com can help owners improve their business performance and try to achieve a higher number of positive reviews.

This project focuses on predicting ratings of restaurants in New York City based on the features of each restaurant (price range, number of reviews, opening hours, etc.) that are available on Yelp.com. This is done by acquiring the restaurants data using web scraping techniques. After that data cleaning and preprocessing. Then, perform features engineering and finally train the model using Linear Regression algorithm and analyze the results

## Approach


## Data Acquisition


## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The following steps of data cleansing and preprocessing were performed on the dataset to help in the analysis process and to ensure that the data is correct, consistent and useable.

- __Eliminating the unnecessary columns:__ After the dataframe was loaded, some columns were dropped that would not contribute to our analysis. They include 'Restaurant Name', 'Restaurant ', 'DIVISION', 'DESC'.

- __Calculating the Filtering the data to include only the dates in the month of may__

  box-shadow: 0 1px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  border-radius: 0;
  display: block;

  width: 100%;"/>

- __Detecting and handling outliers:__ We have found that there are some records that looked really abnormal and the one and only
